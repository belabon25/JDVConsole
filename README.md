# JDVConsole
My first c++ app. The game of life on a console application. more features to come.

I want to add a simple way to put your own pattern in the program, so i'll make a system of txt files in wich you can add your pattern and try it.
Right now the project is really boring and not very interesting, please wait until the new features come.
